### Part 1. One-way ANOVA to compare penguin flipper lengths

![](penguin-heights.jpg)

Read in data, get some counts, etc.


```{r}

penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()

```

Find some counts based on species and sex:
```{r}

penguin_counts <- penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex)

penguin_counts

```

Is there a significant difference in mean flipper length for female penguins across the 3 species?

Create a subset that only contains observations for female penguins, then visually explore the distributions for each species:
```{r}
# Create subset with only female penguins
penguin_f <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "FEMALE")

# Visually explore the distribution of flipper lengths for the three species:

# Histrograms
ggplot(data = penguin_f, aes(flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~species)

# Quantile-quantile plot:
ggplot(data = penguin_f, aes(sample = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~species)

# These are exploratory, probably wouldn't show up in final report. Look close to normally distributed, all groups n > 30 >>> use parametric one-way ANOVA to compare flipper lengths. Could put in methods: prior to hypothesis testing these steps were taken to get to this conclusion ^.

```

Find summary statistics (if comparing means, good idea to look at them first) using group_by() and summarize(): 
```{r}

penguins_f_summary <- penguin_f %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
    sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
    sample_size = n(), # if already in group_by function, then just use n
    se_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm / sqrt(n())),
    var_flipper_length = var(flipper_length_mm)
  )
#standard error (se_flipper_length) is measure of precision of that mean estimate

```

Levene's test:
```{r}
leveneTest(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)
# Comparing variance of flipper length between these species
# Null hypothesis about flipper lengths: no significant difference in variance of flipper length between groups (species)
# Using significance level of 0.05 this means we retain null hypothesis of equal variances
```

Beeswarm plot with mean and standard deviation overlayed on it:

```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_beeswarm(data = penguin_f,
                aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm),
                size = 2,
                alpha = 0.6,
                pch = 16,
                color = "gray70") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo")) +
  geom_point(data = penguins_f_summary, aes(x = species, y = mean_flipper_length)) + # If pulling from different data frames, make sure order is the same
  geom_errorbar(data = penguins_f_summary, # Add error bar extending up 1 SD and down 1 SD
                aes(x = species,
                    ymin = mean_flipper_length - sd_flipper_length,
                    ymax = mean_flipper_length + sd_flipper_length),
                width = 0.1) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Flipper length (mm)")
```

**Figure 1.** Flipper lengths (mm) for Adelie (n = ), Chinstrap (n = ), and Gentoo (n = ) penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica. Means indicated by black points; error bars indicate $\pm$ 1 standard deviation. Data source: 

```{r}

penguin_aov <- aov(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)
summary(penguin_aov)
 # There IS a significant difference in mean flipper lengths between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins at Palmer Station (F(2, 162) = 411.8, p < 0.0001).
```

Well, if means aren't equal, then which ones differ?
```{r}
TukeyHSD(penguin_aov)
```

One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD reveals a significant difference in mean female flipper length between all species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) (stats results...).

### Part 2. Tables and proportions and chi-square
```{r}

party_religion <- gss_cat %>% 
  filter(partyid %in% c ("Strong republican", "Strong democrat")) %>% 
  filter(relig %in% c("None", "Catholic")) %>% 
  count(partyid, relig)

party_relig_table <- party_religion %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = relig, values_from = n)

party_relig_table

```

Make a nice table of counts and proportions within each group:
```{r}

party_relig_prop <- party_relig_table %>% 
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

party_relig_prop

kable(party_relig_prop) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

Run chi-square test for independence.

First, get only a contingency table (values only; no additional columns)

```{r}

chi_counts <- party_relig_table %>% 
  select(-partyid)

chi_counts
```

A couple ways to ask a question that would prompt chi-square:

- Is there a significant difference in religious affiliation (none/Catholic) between strong democrats and strong republicans?

- Is there a significant association between party affiliation (strong dem/strong republican) on religious affiliation (none/Catholic)

```{r}

chisq.test(chi_counts)

```

H0 (null hypothesis): No significant association between categores (political affiliatio and religious affiliation are independent)

- There is a significant association between partyid and religious affiliation ($\chi^2$ = `r `) 

- Religous affiliation (none/Catholic) differed significantly between strong democrats and strong republicans...

- Proportions of people identifying as either atheist or Catholic differed significantly for Strong Republicans or Strong Democrats...

("..." caveats being we restricted the groups a lot)
